<p>Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET) v2.1 after Cohen et al. (2022) [doi:10.3390/rs14215313]. Calculates floodwater depths using a digital elevation model (DEM) and a flood extent polygon. NOTE this algorithm was ported from ArcPy and therefore may behave differently from the original.</p>

<h3>Input data expectations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Terrain Raster (DEM)</strong>: Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the flooded region. Expects a single-band raster with elevation values (e.g., meters). Null-value behavior has not been tested. For best results, ensure this data aligns well with your flooding polygon (e.g., similar date) and has a relatively fine resolution. </li>
    <li><strong>Inundation Polygon</strong>: Vector layer polygon of the flood footprint from which you would like to estimate flood depths. For best results, remove noise and errenous geometries (e.g., holes from clouds). </li>
</ul>

     
<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
First experiment with the test data, then experiment with a small subset of your data before moving onto your full dataset. 
Try removing small holes ('Delete Holes') and islands (select by feature size and delete) from your inundation polygon.
Read the log warnings carefully.
If the tool is very slow, try running 'Simplify' on the inundation polygon first or dividing the domain.
For geographic CRS, try r.grow.distance metric = euclidean.


<h3>Algorithm steps</h3>
1) Clip and pre-check.
2) Compute the shore/boundary pixels (filtering, smoothing, etc.).
3) Grow/extend the shore/boundary pixels onto the full domain using <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass82/manuals/r.grow.distance.html">r.grow.distance</a>.
4) Clip and subtract with DEM to compute depths.
5) Apply low-pass filter.
