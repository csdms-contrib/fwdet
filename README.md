# Updates:
### 2023-10-20
Implemented in [QGIS as a processing script](./qgis_port)

### 2022-08-24
Implemented in:
- >= ArcGis 10.5
- ArcGis Pro
- Google Earth Engine
    
# Description
Within this repository resides the three versions of
FwDET. Version 1, featured in Estimating Floodwater Depths from Flood
Inundation Maps and Topography [Cohen et al. 2018], best works in
inland riverine regions and has been implemented using both Arcpy and
QGIS. Version 2, features an improved algorithm which better solves
coastal flooding as well as fluvial [Cohen et al. 2019]. Version 2 implements a much
different approach that is considerably more computationally
efficient, drastically reducing run time compared to version 1 of the
tool. Version 2.1 introduces a boundary cell smoothing and filtering procedure which
improves the tool's accuracy [Cohen et al. 2022].

# Installation

## ArcMap/Pro Toolbox
1. Clone this repository or download the 
[toolbox file](fwdet/FwDET.tbx).
2. Open ArcMap/Pro and navigate using the catalog to the directory
   containing `FwDET_ArcGISPro.tbx`.
3. Expand the toolbox and double click on the tool version you wish to
   use.
   
## QGIS
see [qgis/README.md](qgis/README.md)

## Development
NOTE: project uses git lfs
